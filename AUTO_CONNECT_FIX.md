# Auto-Connect Fix

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**

You reported that sometimes when you press "Connect" on one device, the other device automatically connects without you pressing the connect button.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The auto-retry logic I implemented was too aggressive:
- When a connection failed, it would automatically retry up to 3 times
- This auto-retry would trigger a new connection attempt even if the user didn't want to connect
- The auto-retry would put the device back in the queue, potentially matching with another device

## ✅ **Fix Implemented**

### **Smart Auto-Retry Logic**

I added a `userInitiatedConnection` flag that tracks whether the user actually pressed the connect button:

```javascript
// Only auto-retry if user was actively trying to connect
if (this.retryCount < 3 && this.userInitiatedConnection) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(`🔄 Auto-retrying connection (attempt ${this.retryCount + 1}/3)...`);
        this.connectBtn.click();
    }, 3000);
} else {
    this.retryCount = 0; // Reset for next manual attempt
    this.userInitiatedConnection = false; // Reset flag
}
```

### **Flag Management**

The flag is set and reset in key places:

1. **Set when user clicks connect**: `this.userInitiatedConnection = true`
2. **Reset when leaving queue**: `this.userInitiatedConnection = false`
3. **Reset after call ends**: `this.userInitiatedConnection = false`
4. **Reset after partner disconnects**: `this.userInitiatedConnection = false`

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior Now**

### **Normal Flow**
1. **User A** clicks "Connect me to someone" → joins queue
2. **User B** clicks "Connect me to someone" → joins queue
3. **Both users** get matched and connected
4. **Connection works** or fails naturally

### **Failure Recovery**
1. **Connection fails** → user sees "Connection failed"
2. **Auto-retry only if** the user originally clicked connect
3. **No auto-retry** if the user was just sitting idle
4. **Manual retry** required if auto-retries are exhausted

### **No More Unwanted Connections**
- **Device A** won't auto-connect just because **Device B** pressed connect
- **Each device** only connects when its user explicitly wants to
- **Auto-retry** only happens for the device that initiated the connection

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Flag States**
- `userInitiatedConnection = true`: User clicked connect, auto-retry allowed
- `userInitiatedConnection = false`: User didn't click connect, no auto-retry

### **Reset Conditions**
- User leaves queue manually
- Call ends (either user ends it)
- Partner disconnects
- Auto-retry attempts exhausted

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **Test Scenario 1: Normal Connection**
1. **Device A**: Click "Connect me to someone"
2. **Device B**: Click "Connect me to someone"
3. **Expected**: Both connect normally

### **Test Scenario 2: Connection Failure**
1. **Device A**: Click "Connect me to someone"
2. **Device B**: Click "Connect me to someone"
3. **Simulate failure**: Close one browser tab quickly
4. **Expected**: Only Device A auto-retries (the one that clicked connect)

### **Test Scenario 3: Idle Device**
1. **Device A**: Click "Connect me to someone"
2. **Device B**: Leave idle (don't click anything)
3. **Expected**: Device B stays idle, doesn't auto-connect

## 🎉 **Result**

Now each device will only connect when its user explicitly wants to connect. The auto-retry feature still helps with temporary connection issues, but only for the device that initiated the connection attempt.

*The fix ensures that Hence respects user intent and doesn't create unwanted connections.* 🎯✨
