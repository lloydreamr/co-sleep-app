### **🎯 Technical Implementation Details**

**Middleware Stack Order (Critical for Security):**
```javascript
1. Request Validation (content-type, size limits)
2. Security Headers (CSP, HSTS, frame protection)  
3. Additional Security Headers (remove server info)
4. Input Sanitization (XSS/injection prevention)
5. Suspicious Activity Detection (pattern matching)
6. Performance Monitoring (request timing)
7. Audit Logging (request/response tracking)
8. CORS Configuration (production domains)
9. Enhanced JSON Parsing (size monitoring)
10. Route-Specific Rate Limiting (auth vs api vs static)
```

**Logging Levels with Color Coding:**
```
ERROR (Red) - Application errors, crashes
WARN (Yellow) - Degraded performance, non-critical issues  
INFO (Cyan) - Normal operations, startup, shutdown
DEBUG (White) - Development debugging (disabled in production)
SECURITY (Magenta) - Security events, rate limits, suspicious activity
PERFORMANCE (Green) - Performance metrics, slow requests, alerts
AUDIT (Blue) - User actions, authentication, authorization
```

**Performance Alert Integration:**
```javascript
performanceMonitor.on('alert:triggered', (alert) => {
  logger.performance(`Performance alert: ${alert.message}`);
  
  if (alert.severity === 'critical') {
    logger.security('Critical performance alert triggered', alert);
  }
