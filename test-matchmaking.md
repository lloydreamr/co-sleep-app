# Matchmaking Test Guide

## üéØ What Was Fixed

The matchmaking system now has:
- **Role Assignment**: One device is the "initiator", one is the "responder"
- **No Race Conditions**: Only the initiator creates the WebRTC offer
- **Connection Timeout**: 15-second timeout to prevent hanging connections
- **Better Error Handling**: Automatic cleanup and reconnection

## üì± How to Test

### Step 1: Open Both Devices
1. **Computer**: `https://localhost:3000`
2. **Mobile**: `https://10.0.0.31:3000`

### Step 2: Join Queue
1. **Both devices**: Click "Connect me to someone"
2. **Watch the logs**: You should see clear initiator/responder roles

### Step 3: Monitor Connection
**Expected Behavior:**
- **Initiator**: Shows "Connecting..." then "Connected"
- **Responder**: Shows "Waiting for connection..." then "Connected"
- **Both**: Should hear each other clearly

## üîç What to Look For

### Console Logs (F12 on computer)
```
Match found with: [ID] Initiator: true/false
Creating offer as initiator...
Waiting for offer as responder...
‚úÖ WebRTC connection established successfully!
```

### Server Logs (Terminal)
```
Matching [ID1] with [ID2]
Offer from [initiator] to [responder]
Answer from [responder] to [initiator]
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If Still Not Working:
1. **Clear browser cache** on both devices
2. **Check console logs** for errors
3. **Wait 15 seconds** - timeout will trigger retry
4. **Try refreshing** both pages

### Common Issues:
- **"Connection failed"**: Network/firewall blocking WebRTC
- **"Waiting for connection..." forever**: Initiator failed to create offer
- **No audio**: Microphone permissions not granted

## üéß Expected Experience

1. **Instant matching** - should connect within 2-3 seconds
2. **Clear roles** - one device initiates, one responds
3. **Smooth connection** - no more race conditions
4. **Clear audio** - no echo, good quality
5. **Graceful failures** - automatic retry on timeout
