# File Hygiene & Naming Rules

– Avoid creating files over 300 lines of code—refactor them into smaller parts  
– Every file must have a clear and singular purpose  
– Avoid dumping unrelated functions or utilities into the same file  
– Match plural/singular naming across folders and files consistently  
– Do not use vague folder names like `misc`, `common`, or `temp` unless scoped clearly  
– Add a comment at the top of each file describing its purpose, if not obvious  
– Remove unused files, folders, and dead imports as soon as they are no longer needed
