# Design Intent Rules

– Every new pattern or file must have a clear reason for existing  
– Always leave a note or comment explaining why a new structure or file was introduced  
– Prefer explicit and self-explanatory architecture over cleverness  
– Avoid introducing abstractions unless there is a clear, repeated need  
– Keep features modular and scoped to a domain or purpose  
– Remove legacy or deprecated structures when replacing them with new ones  
– Don’t guess—if the purpose of a design decision is unclear, clarify it before building on top of it
