# AI Agent Collaboration Rules

– AI agents must not touch files outside of the open task or specified scope  
– Avoid making changes to unrelated code or files without clear context or reasoning  
– Summarize all structural changes in plain English within the PR or output  
– Do not introduce new libraries, folders, or naming patterns unless they already exist in the codebase  
– When generating new files, explain their purpose clearly and follow existing conventions  
– Respect the boundaries and logic of existing code before replacing or refactoring it  
– Never create random helper files, config files, or utils without a clear architectural need
