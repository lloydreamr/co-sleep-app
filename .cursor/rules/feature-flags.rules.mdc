# Feature Flag Rules

– All feature flags must follow the naming convention: `feature:[area]:[short-description]`  
– Do not leave feature flags in the codebase longer than 60 days without review  
– Every feature flag must include a removal plan or condition before being merged  
– Avoid hardcoding feature flag defaults—use environment variables or toggles  
– When removing a flag, remove all related code and clean up traces  
– Don’t ship new features behind flags without confirming the flag logic is test-covered  
– Never use flags to delay architectural decisions—use them only for controlled rollouts
