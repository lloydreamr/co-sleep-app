# Code Lifecycle & Ownership Rules

– All code should either be owned, deprecated, or marked for removal  
– Never leave behind code with no clear owner or responsibility  
– When removing old code, describe what it was doing and what replaces it  
– Mark legacy logic with `// @deprecated` and link to a migration or replacement plan  
– Don’t leave unused flags, features, or branches without review  
– Avoid introducing logic that won’t be maintained or tracked long-term  
– If ownership is unclear, tag it for triage and document that fact
