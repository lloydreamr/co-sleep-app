# Testing & Reliability Rules

– Always write tests for new core functionality or shared logic  
– Avoid skipping tests unless the work is explicitly flagged as throwaway or experimental  
– Never test against live APIs or real services in dev or test environments  
– Keep test files clean and scoped to the feature they validate  
– Re-run affected downstream tests after changes to shared methods or logic  
– Don’t leave failing or flakey tests in the codebase  
– Every feature must be testable—even if tests are deferred, confirm that coverage is planned
